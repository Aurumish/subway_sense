# Project Summary: Transit Safety API

This document outlines the recent changes made to the Transit Safety API, shifting its focus from a general research agent to a targeted, station-specific safety analysis tool with AI-powered verification.

## Key Architectural Changes

1.  **Station-Specific Queries:** The API has been refactored to accept a specific subway station name (e.g., "Times Square") instead of a generic search query. This allows for more focused and relevant safety reports.

2.  **Dual-AI Verification System:** A new verification layer has been added to the research process.
    *   **Cerebras:** Performs the initial web search and generates a preliminary safety report.
    *   **Google Gemini Flash 2.5:** Acts as a verifier. It reviews the sources found by the initial search and cross-references them with the Cerebras report to produce a final, more accurate and verified summary.

## File-by-File Breakdown

### `requirements.txt`
*   Added the `google-genai` library to support the new Gemini API integration.

### `app.py` (Flask Server)
*   The `/research` endpoint has been modified to expect a `station` field in the incoming JSON request.
*   The server now calls the refactored `deeper_research_topic` function, passing the station name to it.
*   The existing logic for parsing and sorting the final report remains, ensuring the frontend receives a clean, ordered list of incidents.

### `agent.py` (Core Logic)
*   **Global Gemini Client:** A single, reusable `gemini_client` is now instantiated at the global scope to improve efficiency and code clarity.
*   **`generate(prompt)` function:** A new function has been added to encapsulate all Gemini API interactions. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
*   **`verify_with_gemini(sources, cerebras_report)` function:** This function has been refactored to be a simpler pass-through to the `generate` function, separating the concerns of prompt creation and API interaction.
*   **.env Loading:** The script now uses `python-dotenv` with an explicit path to ensure that API keys are loaded reliably, regardless of the execution directory.

## Troubleshooting & Resolution

The initial implementation of the Gemini API integration was plagued by a persistent `ValueError: Missing key inputs argument!`. This was a challenging issue to debug, and the following steps were taken to resolve it:

*   **Initial Diagnosis:** The error message clearly indicated that the `GEMINI_API_key` was not being passed correctly to the `genai.Client`.
*   **Incorrect Assumptions:** Several early attempts to fix the issue were based on incorrect assumptions about the `google-genai` library and the `python-dotenv` loading mechanism. These included:
    *   Attempting to use `genai.configure()`.
    *   Incorrectly instantiating the client inside the `verify_with_gemini` function.
    *   Attempting to manually parse the `.env` file.
*   **The Solution:** The issue was finally resolved by implementing a combination of best practices:
    1.  **Correct `.env` Loading:** Using `load_dotenv(dotenv_path=dotenv_path)` at the top of the script proved to be the most reliable way to ensure the API keys were loaded into the environment.
    2.  **Global Client:** Creating a single, global `gemini_client` instance, as suggested by the user, improved the code's structure and prevented potential scope issues.
    3.  **Correct API Pattern:** Adhering to the user-provided example of the correct API pattern for the `google-genai` library was the final piece of the puzzle.

## Next Steps

With the Gemini API integration now working correctly, the next step is to run the Flask application and test the end-to-end functionality of the safety research agent.
